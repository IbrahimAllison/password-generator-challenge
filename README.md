# password-generator-challenge

**Description**
This project involves the creation of an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on the password criteria chosen by the employee. The main objective of this unique password generator tool is to generate a strong password with a mixture of numeric, lowercase, uppercase, and special characters, which would make it difficult for intruders to guess or hack.

**Motivation for the Project**
I am highly motivated to complete this challenge. I was able to learn how JavaScript is applicable to solving real life situations. The importance of using strong and secure passwords cannot be over-emphasized.

**What Problem Does It Solve?**
It solves the problem of insecure passwords, unauthorized access to the user account, and protects users identifiable and confidential information. It also guides against attacks by social engineers and hackers.

**Usage**
The project contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes. The user clicks on the "Generate Password" button at the bottom of the page. Validation message displays on the screen prompting the user to enter the required data and click on the OK or the Cancel buttons. 

The user continues to respond to the pop-up messages until a password is generated and displayed in the text box.
